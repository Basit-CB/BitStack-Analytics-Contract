STX-BitStack Analytics Contract
Overview
The STX-BitStack Analytics Contract is a smart contract designed for advanced DeFi analytics, staking, governance, and emergency management within the Stacks blockchain ecosystem. The contract provides a multi-tier staking system that incentivizes long-term STX staking through a system of tier levels, lock periods, and bonus multipliers. It also features a governance module, allowing users with sufficient voting power to propose and vote on important protocol changes. Finally, emergency functions enable contract pausing and resumption to ensure security.

Features
1. Multi-Tier Staking System Staking: Users can stake STX and optionally lock it for a set period, which increases the reward multiplier. Tier Levels: The contract defines three tiers based on the amount staked, each with unique benefits and multipliers. Cooldown Period: Users can initiate unstaking, which activates a cooldown period to prevent immediate withdrawals, helping stabilize liquidity. Rewards Calculation: Rewards are calculated based on staked amount, staking tier, and lock period multiplier.

2. Governance Module Proposal Creation: Users with sufficient voting power can propose changes to the contract. Voting on Proposals: Users can vote on active proposals, with options to vote “for” or “against.” Proposal Execution: Proposals with majority votes can be executed, enabling decentralized decision-making.

3. Emergency Management Contract Pause/Resume: The contract owner can pause or resume the contract in case of emergencies. Emergency Mode: Additional safety for managing unforeseen risks or securing funds.

Constants and Parameters
contract-owner: The address that deployed the contract and has administrative rights.
Base Reward Rate: The default rate (e.g., 5%) used to calculate staking rewards.
Bonus Rate: An additional bonus for longer staking lock periods.
Cooldown Period: Specifies the cooldown period before completing unstake, measured in blocks.
Tier Levels: Defines the minimum staking requirements and reward multipliers for each tier.
Key Data Structures
UserPositions: Records a user’s staking details, collateral, debt, tier level, voting power, and other analytics-related data.
StakingPositions: Tracks the amount of STX staked, lock period, cooldown period, and accumulated rewards.
Proposals: Stores governance proposals with metadata like description, start and end block, vote counts, and execution status.
TierLevels: Defines tier configurations with minimum stake requirements, reward multipliers, and enabled features. Function Overview
Staking Functions
(stake-stx (amount uint) (lock-period uint))

Allows users to stake STX tokens and optionally lock them for a specific period to gain higher rewards.
Calculates tier level and reward multiplier based on the staking amount and lock period. (initiate-unstake (amount uint))
Begins the unstaking process by setting a cooldown period.
Ensures that no other cooldown is active for the user. (complete-unstake)
Finalizes the unstaking after the cooldown period has elapsed.
Transfers the staked STX back to the user and clears their staking record. (calculate-rewards (user principal) (blocks uint)) (private)
Computes the rewards based on the user’s staked amount, tier, and multiplier.
Can be called by staking functions for reward calculation.
Governance Functions
(create-proposal (description (string-utf8 256)) (voting-period uint))
Allows users with sufficient voting power to create a governance proposal.
Sets up the proposal with start and end block numbers, and initializes vote counts.
(vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote-for bool))

Allows users to vote on an active proposal.
Voting power is determined by the user's staked amount, and the votes are recorded in the proposal's metadata.
Emergency Management Functions
(pause-contract)

Pauses contract operations during emergencies, preventing functions like staking or unstaking from executing. (resume-contract)
Resumes normal operations if the contract is in a paused state.
Helper Functions
(calculate-lock-multiplier (lock-period uint)) (private)

Determines the reward multiplier based on the lock period.
Multiplier options: 2 months: 1.5x 1 month: 1.25x No lock: 1x (get-tier-info (stake-amount uint)) (private)
Retrieves the tier level and corresponding reward multiplier based on the user’s total staked amount.
